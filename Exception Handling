-The throws keyword is recommended for checked exceptions because the compiler enforces handling or declaration of checked exceptions.
-If we use throws for an unchecked exception, the compiler will not force us to handle it, since unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile time.
-The throw keyword can be used for both checked and unchecked exceptions.
	When throw is used for an unchecked exception, the compiler does not force handling.
	When throw is used for a checked exception, the compiler forces us to either handle it using try–catch or declare it using the throws keyword.
